# Even numbers (2, 4, 6, 8) and odd numbers (1, 3, 5, 7)  pop up a lot in programming. 
# Knowing them is key to solving many coding problems.
# An even number is divisible by 2. An odd number leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 2.
# So how can we program this? We can use the % modulo operator to find the remainder:
# Even → n % 2 == 0
# Odd → n % 2 == 1
# Create a num variable and give it any number.
# Use a print() and % modulo operator to see if it's divisible by 2.

# Create a num variable and give it any number
num = 7

# Use a print() and % modulo operator to see if it's divisible by 2
print(num % 2)

num = 8

# This asks Python: "Is the remainder of num divided by 2 equal to 0?"
print(num % 2 == 0)  # This will print: True
